Individual Final Project
My final individual project is a countdown timer that is displayed on an arduino lcd screen.  It incorporates the Liquid Crystal arduino library and also resets the timer after a button is pressed. My design process started with how to make the timer appear on the lcd.  This basically consisted of looping an integer of how many seconds the round was assigned,  this ended up being 120 or 2 minutes. Then I wrote the code to have it appear on the lcd which consisted of just a print statement and the setup code. Finally I implemented the start/ reset button and debounced it. This allowed the players to start and reset the game as many times as they wanted.  What is unique about my design compared to others is the button that restarts it after each round.  This allows for the multiplayer capability to carry on for as many rounds as the players need.  The other portion of the pinball project I was responsible for was the mechanics of the scoring system which Matt modified to work with the touch sensors he implemented.  I wrote the base program which was used in the touch sensor code he wrote.
